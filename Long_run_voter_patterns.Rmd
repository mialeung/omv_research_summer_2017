## Question
What is the long-run pattern of voter registration in Oregon? How has this changed with the start of AVR?
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(foreign)
library(readxl)
```


```{r import, include=T}
setwd("~/Google Drive/AVR/data/Monthly_Voter_Registration Reports/xlsx_Versions_by_Year/2017/")
file_names <- list.files(pattern = "0*.xlsx")

read.myfiles <- function(filename) {
  d <- read_xlsx(filename, sheet = "Raw Data")
  #d$name <- filename
}

mydata <- lapply(file_names, read.myfiles)
mydata2 <- bind_rows(mydata)
#years <- c(2012, 2013, 2014, 2015,2016,2017) 
# apply (years, MARGIN= c(0,1), FUN= years + 1 )


```
