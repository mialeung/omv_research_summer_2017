## Question
What is the long-run pattern of voter registration in Oregon? How has this changed with the start of AVR?
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r import, include=FALSE}
load(readxl)
jun17 <- read_excel("/Users/mialeung/Google Drive/AVR/data/Monthly Voter Registration Reports/xlsx Versions by Year/2017/06-17.xlsx")
```
